<div id="figure of speech" class="wiikipedia" >
   A figure of speech or rhetorical figure is a category of literary or linguistic terms, with two related meanings. The first meaning is the broader and more technical one: a synonym for literary device,[1][2] particularly when divided into two sub-types: schemes, variations deviating from the usual sequence of words, and tropes or figures, deviations of the words themselves from ordinary usage. This meaning dates back to the Renaissance humanists, themselves inspired by the classical rhetoricians.[2]

The second meaning of figure of speech is narrower and its most common one colloquially—essentially, a synonym for trope as defined above: any word or phrase that deviates from straightforward language use or literal meaning to produce a persuasive or other intensified effect (emotionally, aesthetically, intellectually, etc.).[3][4][5][6] In the distinction between literal and figurative language, figures of speech constitute the latter.

This article focuses on the first, broader meaning.

Four rhetorical operations
Main article: Rhetorical operations
Classical rhetoricians classified figures of speech into four categories or quadripita ratio:[7]

addition (adiectio), also called repetition/expansion/superabundance
omission (detractio), also called subtraction/abridgement/lack
transposition (transmutatio), also called transferring
permutation (immutatio), also called switching/interchange/substitution/transmutation
These categories are often still used. The earliest known text listing them, though not explicitly as a system, is the Rhetorica ad Herennium, of unknown authorship, where they are called πλεονασμός (pleonasmos—addition), ἔνδεια (endeia—omission), μετάθεσις (metathesis—transposition) and ἐναλλαγή (enallage—permutation).[8] Quintillian then mentioned them in Institutio Oratoria.[9] Philo of Alexandria also listed them as addition (πρόσθεσις—prosthesis), subtraction (ἀφαίρεσις—afairesis), transposition (μετάθεσις—metathesis), and transmutation (ἀλλοίωσις—alloiosis).[10]
